Pydantic is a Python library that uses type hints to validate, parse,
and serialize data at runtime. It automatically converts untrusted
input (like JSON) into clean, type-checked Python objects, ensuring
fields match expected types and formats. This helps prevent bad data
from entering your system, eliminates manual validation code, and
provides clear, structured error messages. Pydantic is widely used in
frameworks like FastAPI to enforce data integrity, generate schemas,
and keep APIs type-safe and maintainable.
