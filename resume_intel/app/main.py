# Project Concept: “Resume Intelligence API”
# A small but real AI microservice that:
# -> Takes a resume (text or JSON) and returns structured insights (skills, roles, experience years).
# -> Supports FastAPI endpoints for parsing and matching.
# -> Uses LangGraph for reasoning + extraction flow control.
# -> Employs Pydantic models + typing for data contracts.
# -> Is ready for extension into later “Job Matching” work (Day 13).
