## Debugging vs Print Statements Notes

### 💡 What is a Breakpoint?

A **breakpoint** is a marker in your code that tells the program to *pause execution* at that exact line.
When paused, you can inspect variables, step through code, and understand what’s happening in real time.

### 🖨️ Why Not Just Use Print Statements?

Print statements show variable values, but they have major limitations:

| Feature                         | `print()`              | Breakpoint                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| View all variables              | ❌ Only what you print  | ✅ See every variable in scope |
| Step through code               | ❌ Can’t                | ✅ Step line-by-line           |
| Modify values live              | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                         |
| Async / multithreaded debugging | ❌ Messy output         | ✅ Clear and organized         |
| Clean code (no extra prints)    | ❌ Need to delete later | ✅ No code changes             |

### 🧠 Key Advantages of Breakpoints

1. **Inspect everything:**
   You can see all variables, local and global, without adding print statements.

2. **Step through code:**
   Use:

   * **Step Into** → go inside a function call
   * **Step Over** → execute a line without diving in
   * **Step Out** → finish the current function and return to the caller

3. **Modify state live:**
   You can change variable values, run custom expressions, or test different inputs on the fly.

4. **Keep your code clean:**
   Debugging doesn’t clutter your file with extra logs — it’s all handled by the IDE (like VSCode).

5. **Async and threads:**
   With asynchronous code or multiple threads, print statements get jumbled.
   Debuggers show exactly *which coroutine or thread* is running and what it’s doing.

### ⚙️ In Short

| Task                  | Print | Debugger |
| --------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| View all state        | ❌     | ✅        |
| Step control          | ❌     | ✅        |
| Modify live           | ❌     | ✅        |
| Works well with async | ❌     | ✅        |
| Keeps code clean      | ❌     | ✅        |

### 🧩 TL;DR

Use **print()** for quick sanity checks.
Use **breakpoints** for serious debugging — they’re cleaner, faster, and far more powerful.
